# 389. Find the Difference

🔗 [LeetCode Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-difference)

---

## 📘 Problem Description

You are given two strings `s` and `t`.

String `t` is generated by random shuffling string `s` and then adding **one more letter** at a random position.

Return the letter that was added to `t`.

---

## 📝 Examples

### Example 1:
**Input:**
```
s = "abcd"
t = "abcde"
```

**Output:**
```
"e"
```

**Explanation:**
`'e'` is the letter that was added.

---

### Example 2:
**Input:**
```
s = ""
t = "y"
```

**Output:**
```
"y"
```

---

## 🔒 Constraints
- `0 <= s.length <= 1000`
- `t.length == s.length + 1`
- `s` and `t` consist of lowercase English letters.

---

## 💡 Approaches

### Approach 1: Frequency Counting (HashMap / Array)
1. Count frequency of each letter in `s`.
2. Subtract frequencies from `t`.
3. The extra character is the answer.

⏱️ **Time Complexity:** O(n)  
💾 **Space Complexity:** O(1) (since only 26 lowercase letters)

---

### Approach 2: ASCII Sum Difference
1. Take sum of ASCII values of all characters in `t`.
2. Subtract sum of ASCII values of characters in `s`.
3. The difference corresponds to the added character.

---

### Approach 3: XOR Trick
1. XOR all characters of `s` and `t` together.
2. Since duplicates cancel out (`a ^ a = 0`), only the extra character remains.

⏱️ **Time Complexity:** O(n)  
💾 **Space Complexity:** O(1)

## 🚀 Solutions

### ✅ Java Solution (XOR)
```java
class Solution {
    public char findTheDifference(String s, String t) {
        int result = 0;

        for (char ch : s.toCharArray()) {
            result ^= ch;
        }
        for (char ch : t.toCharArray()) {
            result ^= ch;
        }

        return (char) result;
    }
}
```

---

### ✅ Python Solution (XOR)
```python
class Solution:
    def findTheDifference(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:
        result = 0
        for ch in s:
            result ^= ord(ch)
        for ch in t:
            result ^= ord(ch)
        return chr(result)
```

---

## 🎯 Key Takeaway
This problem can be solved in multiple ways, but the **XOR trick** is the most elegant and efficient since it avoids extra space.
